# HOMEWORK-DATACAMP-25

Docker & SQL
In this homework we'll prepare the environment and practice with Docker and SQL

## Question 1. Knowing docker tags
Run the command to get information on Docker

docker --help

Now run the command to get help on the "docker build" command:

docker build --help

Do the same for "docker run".

Which tag has the following text? - Automatically remove the container when it exits

--delete
--rc
--rmc
--rm

## Question 2. Understanding docker first run
Run docker with the python:3.9 image in an interactive mode and the entrypoint of bash. Now check the python modules that are installed ( use pip list ).

What is version of the package wheel ?

0.42.0
1.0.0
23.0.1
58.1.0
Prepare Postgres
Run Postgres and load data as shown in the videos We'll use the green taxi trips from September 2019:

wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/green/green_tripdata_2019-09.csv.gz

You will also need the dataset with zones:

wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/misc/taxi+_zone_lookup.csv

Download this data and put it into Postgres (with jupyter notebooks or with a pipeline)




## Question 3. Count records
How many taxi trips were totally made on September 18th 2019?

Tip: started and finished on 2019-09-18.

Remember that lpep_pickup_datetime and lpep_dropoff_datetime columns are in the format timestamp (date and hour+min+sec) and not in date.

15767
15612
15859
89009

## Question 4. Longest trip for each day
Which was the pick up day with the longest trip distance? Use the pick up time for your calculations.

Tip: For every trip on a single day, we only care about the trip with the longest distance.

2019-09-18
2019-09-16
2019-09-26
2019-09-21

## Question 5. Three biggest pick up Boroughs
Consider lpep_pickup_datetime in '2019-09-18' and ignoring Borough has Unknown

Which were the 3 pick up Boroughs that had a sum of total_amount superior to 50000?

"Brooklyn" "Manhattan" "Queens"
"Bronx" "Brooklyn" "Manhattan"
"Bronx" "Manhattan" "Queens"
"Brooklyn" "Queens" "Staten Island"

## Question 6. Largest tip
For the passengers picked up in September 2019 in the zone name Astoria which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip? We want the name of the zone, not the id.

Note: it's not a typo, it's tip , not trip

Central Park
Jamaica

## Terraform
In this section homework we'll prepare the environment by creating resources in GCP with Terraform.

In your VM on GCP/Laptop/GitHub Codespace install Terraform. Copy the files from the course repo here to your VM/Laptop/GitHub Codespace.

Modify the files as necessary to create a GCP Bucket and Big Query Dataset.

## Question 7. Creating Resources
After updating the main.tf and variable.tf files run:

terraform apply
Paste the output of this command into the homework submission form.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following
execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following
symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_storage_bucket.decamp25 will be created
  + resource "google_storage_bucket" "decamp25" {
      + force_destroy               = true
      + id                          = (known after apply)
      + location                    = "US"
      + name                        = "green-taxi-bucket-2025"
      + project                     = (known after apply)
      + public_access_prevention    = (known after apply)
      + self_link                   = (known after apply)
      + storage_class               = "STANDARD"
      + uniform_bucket_level_access = true
      + url                         = (known after apply)

      + lifecycle_rule {
          + action {
              + type          = "Delete"
                # (1 unchanged attribute hidden)
            }
          + condition {
              + age                    = 30
              + matches_prefix         = []
              + matches_storage_class  = []
              + matches_suffix         = []
              + with_state             = (known after apply)
                # (3 unchanged attributes hidden)
            }
        }

      + versioning {
          + enabled = true
        }

      + website (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

google_storage_bucket.decamp25: Creating...
google_storage_bucket.decamp25: Creation complete after 2s [id=green-taxi-bucket-2025]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
